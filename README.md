# 🧠 AutoGPT UI 

AutoGPT UI is a powerful, easy-to-use web interface for AutoGPT. Developed with Nuxt.js, our tool allows users to manage their AutoGPT workspace with ease. Simply upload an `ai_settings` file and any supporting files, adjust your AutoGPT settings, and start the AutoGPT process all from our intuitive GUI. The interface supports both stand alone and shared user implementations with multi-user individual workspaces.

## 💼 Workspace Management

Our full workspace management interface lets users manage files they've created, as well as drag and drop new files for GPT to work with. This hassle-free approach makes working with GPT a breeze. Manage files and folder in your workspace, making it easy to interact with the source or generated content.
